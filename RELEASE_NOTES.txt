Version 2.0.0  -  XX.12.2023
----------------------------

- Introduction of Ncopy.


Version 1.6.0  -  XX.10.2022
----------------------------

- Improved baseline calculation. The number of cycles 
  in log phase is limited to a maximum of 12.

- GeNorm can select a subset of samples.


Version 1.5.0  -  17.04.2022
----------------------------

- Improved baseline calculation. Minimum PCR efficiency
  is now 1.2, only a found baseline is throwing no
  baseline error and an additional error is implemented
  for instable baseline.

- "ntc", "nac", "ntp", "nrt" and "opt" samples do not
  contribute to mean PCR efficiency calculation.


Version 1.4.0  -  internal
----------------------------

- First implementation of baseline correction for negative
  values. Not released beyond GitHub.


Version 1.3.0  -  14.02.2022
----------------------------

- Implemented RDML-Analyze with absolute quantification.

- Quantities can be attached to a target.

- Improved inter run correction functionality.


Version 1.2.0  -  18.02.2022
----------------------------

- Implemented RDML-Analyze with inter run correction.

- Implemented RDML-Merge to combine two RDML files.

- Runs can be moved to different experiments within a file.

- Modified handling of negative fluorescence values. Before
  they were set to nan, now they are shifted to a small
  positive value.

- Fixed the handling of multiplex files.

- Implemented a function to fix different melting curve
  temperatures within one scan.


Version 1.1.1  -  24.12.2021
----------------------------

- Reduced unnecessary precision in variable output.

- Fixed bug in csv output of curve data.


Version 1.1.0  -  24.11.2021
----------------------------

- RDML files require the xml data in the file rdml_data.xml.
  As some machines do not follow this requirement, the
  function load_any_zip(self, filename) opens the first
  file contained in the compressed archive.

- Upon import of amplification or melting curve data wells
  without the columns Well, Sample, Sample Type, Target, 
  Target Type and Dye are skipped with a message. This is 
  intended to be used for empty wells.
